## Project Synopsis

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering workflow on a realistic e-commerce dataset. The goal is to load raw data, clean and enrich it, and perform basic analytical insights using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It highlights skills in data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, feature engineering, serialization, and object-oriented programming.

## Quick Start (Windows)

Open your command prompt and follow these steps in sequence: first, create a virtual environment by running `python -m venv venv`. Next, activate the virtual environment by running `venv\Scripts\activate`. After that, install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then, launch Jupyter Notebook by running `jupyter notebook`. Finally, open and run the notebook file named `/Data_engineering_lab.ipynb`.
